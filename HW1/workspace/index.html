    <em>Physics, Class of 2015</em>
    <p> I am a 21-year old physicist, musician, and designer studying Physics at UC Berkeley. I build things such as interative art installations, augmented instruments, and audio applications all while striving to develope new ways of learning, communcation, and interaction.This semester I am involved with running a group on campus called the <a href="www.MultimediaOrchestra.com"> Multimedia Orchestra</a> which helps designers, composers, musicians, programers, and artists to collaborate with one another and produce amazing works. At the moment I am working on building an instrument from the ground up with the <a href= "https://www.leapmotion.com/product">Leap Motion Controller</a> and exploring the design challenges of nonphysical interations.
